# This is how we can create our Websites for us and our projects. 

__Hosted directly from your __[GitHub repository](https://github.com)__. Just edit, push, and your changes are live.__

# First of all What is GitHub Pages?

>Just go through this link: __[Github pages](https://pages.github.com)__

__Ready to get started? Build your own site from scratch or generate one for your project.__<br>
You get one site per GitHub account and organization,
and unlimited project sites. Let‘s get started.

 __[User or Organization site]()__ | __[Project site]()__ 
 --------------------------|-------------------
      
## 1. Create a repository 

* Head over to __[GitHub](https://github.com)__ and create a __[new repository](https://github.com/new)__ 
  named username.github.io, where username is your username (or organization name) on GitHub.
  If the first part of the repository doesn’t exactly match your username, it won’t work, so make sure to get it right.

  __What git client are you using?__
  
 A terminal | GitHub Desktop | I don't know ?
 -----------|----------------|---------------
       
Just like below:-

## 2. Clone the repository

* Go to the folder where you want to store your project, and clone the new repository:

   :heavy_dollar_sign: git clone https://github.com/username/username.github.io

## 3. Hello World

* Enter the project folder and add an index.html file:

   :heavy_dollar_sign: cd username.github.io

   :heavy_dollar_sign: echo "Hello World" > index.html

## 4. Push it

* Add, commit, and push your changes:

   :heavy_dollar_sign: git add --all

   :heavy_dollar_sign: git commit -m "Initial commit"

   :heavy_dollar_sign: git push -u origin master


## 5. Finally you're done! :boom:

Fire up a browser and go to https://username.github.io.
